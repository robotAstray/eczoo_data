physical: qudits
logical: qudits

name: 'Double-semion stabilizer code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:cond-mat/0404617,arxiv:2112.11394}'

description: |
  Modular-qudit stabilizer code with qudit dimension \(q=4\) that is characterized by the double semion topological phase. The code can be obtained from the \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) surface code by \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensing} the anyon \(e^2 m^2\) \cite{arxiv:2211.03798}.
  Originally formulated as a non-stabilizer qubit code \cite{arXiv:cond-mat/0404617}.

      detail: 'When treated as ground states of the code Hamiltonian, the code states realize double-semion topological order, a topological phase of matter that also exists in twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) gauge theory \cite{doi:10.1007/BF02096988}.'
  cousins:
    - code_id: surface
      detail: 'The double semion phase also has a realization in terms of qubits \cite{arXiv:cond-mat/0404617} that can be compared to the qubit surface code. There is a logical basis for both the toric and double-semion codes where each codeword is a superposition of states corresponding to all noncontractible loops of a particular homotopy type. The superposition is equal for the toric code, whereas some loops appear with a \(-1\) coefficient for the double semion.'
    - code_id: qudit_surface
      detail: 'The anyon fusion rules for the double-semion code and the \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) surface code are the same, but exchange statistics are different. The double-semion code can be obtained from the \(\mathbb{Z}_4\) surface code by \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensing} the anyon \(e^2 m^2\) \cite{arxiv:2211.03798} or by \hyperref[topic:gauging-out]{gauging out} the one-form symmetry associated with said anyon \cite[Footnote 18]{arxiv:2211.03798}.'
