name: 'Floquet code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:2107.02194}'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{Hastings-Haah code}. Dynamically-generated stabilizer-based code whose logical qubits are generated through a particular sequence of check-operator measurements such that the number of logical qubits is larger than when the code is viewed as a static subsystem stabilizer code.

  After each measurement in the sequence, the codespace is a joint \(+1\) eigenspace of an \textit{instantaneous stabilizer group (ISG)}, i.e., a particular stabilizer group corresponding to the measurement. The ISG specifies the state of the system as a Pauli stabilizer state at a particular round of measurement, and it evolves into a (potentially) different ISG depending on the check operators measured in the next step in the sequence.
  As opposed to subsystem codes, only specific measurement sequences maintain the codespace.

  A measurement can be interpreted as causing anyon \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensation}, thereby mapping the topoligical phase of a given code state into another condensed phase.
  In this way, measurements cycle logical quantum information between various \hyperref[topic:code-switching]{condensed phases} of a parent topological phase \cite{arxiv:2212.00042}.

      detail: 'Both Floquet and monitored random circuit codes can have an instantaneous stabilizer group which evolves through unitary evolution and measurements. However, Floquet codewords are generated via a specific sequence of measurements, while random-circuit codes maintain a stabilizer group after any measurement. Floquet codes have the additional capability of detecting errors induced during the measurement process; see Appx. A of Ref. \cite{arxiv:2107.02194}.'
